## About Me
I just wrapped up my B.S. in Computer Engineering at Michigan State, carving a niche at the intersection of embedded hardware and software. Whether it’s squeezing a 1-D CNN onto a microcontroller, or spinning up a quick Python tool to save everyone a few clicks, I’m happiest when code makes life easier.

* **Interests:** Embedded systems, real-time signal processing, wearables, dev-ops for small teams  
* **Philosophy:** Ship small, learn fast, iterate  
* **Currently exploring:** Rust for bare-metal firmware and LangChain for lightweight LLM apps
